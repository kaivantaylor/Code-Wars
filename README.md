Training my coding skills through critical thinking.

Problems from Code Wars and their given instructions and test cases. All code is submitted and then random test cases that are not listed are given as well.

# 1) Most frequently used words in a text

Write a function that, given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks), returns an array of the top-3 most occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.

Assumptions:
A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (') in ASCII. (No need to handle fancy punctuation.)
Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.
Ties may be broken arbitrarily.
If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, or an empty array if a text contains no words.
Examples:
top_3_words("In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to
mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for
coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most
nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra
on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income.")
["a", "of", "on"]

top_3_words("e e e e DDD ddd DdD: ddd ddd aa aA Aa, bb cc cC e e e")
["e", "ddd", "aa"]

top_3_words("  //wont won't won't")
["won't", "wont"]
Bonus points (not really, but just for fun):
Avoid creating an array whose memory footprint is roughly as big as the input text.
Avoid sorting the entire array of unique words.

# 2) Sum of positive

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

# 3) Equal Sides Of An Array

You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

For example:

Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:
Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.

Let's look at another one.
You are given the array {1,100,50,-51,1,1}:
Your function will return the index 1, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({50,-51,1,1}) both equal 1.

Last one:
You are given the array {20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}
At index 0 the left side is {}
The right side is {10,-80,10,10,15,35}
They both are equal to 0 when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)
Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.

Note: Please remember that in most programming/scripting languages the index of an array starts at 0.

Input:
An integer array of length 0 < arr < 1000. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.

Output:
The lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return -1.

Note:
If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.
An empty array should be treated like a 0 in this problem.

# 4) Regex validate PIN code

ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

eg:

validate_pin("1234") == True
validate_pin("12345") == False
validate_pin("a234") == False

# 5) Create Phone Number

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example:
create_phone_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) # => returns "(123) 456-7890"
The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge. 
Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!

# 6) Consecutive Strings
You are given an array strarr of strings and an integer k. Your task is to return the first longest string consisting of k consecutive strings taken in the array.

Example:
longest_consec(["zone", "abigail", "theta", "form", "libe", "zas", "theta", "abigail"], 2) --> "abigailtheta"

n being the length of the string array, if n = 0 or k > n or k <= 0 return "".

Note
consecutive strings : follow one after another without an interruption

# 7) Mumbling

This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

Examples:

accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

# 8) I said the word WOULD instead of WOULDN'T

Kata Task
In this Kata you will write a method to return what you really meant to say by negating certain words (adding or removing n't)

The words to be negated are drawn from this pool:

are - aren't
can - can't
could - couldn't
did - didn't
do - don't
had - hadn't
has - hasn't
have - haven't
is - isn't
might - mightn't
must - mustn't
should - shouldn't
was - wasn't
were - weren't
would - wouldn't

Input
words - these are the words your brain has trouble with 
(contains only lower case positive form of the word)

speech - what your mouth said

Output
What you meant to say. This is the speech sentence, but with any
of the words (both positive and negative forms) negated
Notes
Case rules
when changing negative to positive the replacement word
must be same case as the original
when changing positive to negative use n't 
(except if the original word (plus any 've part) was entirely uppercase, then use N'T)
Beware of the word can
Beware of punctuation
Beware of variations with an 've suffix, such as should've, would've, could've, etc

Examples
words = ["can", "do", "have", "was", "would"]
speech
I do like pizza. ==> I don't like pizza.
YES, WE CAN ==> YES, WE CAN'T
Wouldn't you believe it? I can't! ==> Would you believe it? I can!

# 8) I said the word WOULD instead of WOULDN'T

# 9) The Hastag Generator

The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with out own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

It must start with a hashtag (#).
All words must have their first letter capitalized.
If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.
Examples
" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"  =>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
"    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"
""                                        =>  false

# 10) Can you get the loop ?

You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list always contains a tail and a loop.

Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

For example in the following picture the tail's size is 3 and the loop size is 11.

Use the `next' attribute to get the following node

node.next

# 11) Sum of Parts

Let us consider this example (array written in general format):

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]

Its following parts:

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]
ls = [1, 3, 6, 10]
ls = [3, 6, 10]
ls = [6, 10]
ls = [10]
ls = []
The corresponding sums are (put together in a list): [20, 20, 19, 16, 10, 0]

The function parts_sums (or its variants in other languages) will take as parameter a list ls and return a list of the sums of its parts as defined above.

Other Examples:
ls = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 
parts_sums(ls) -> [21, 20, 18, 15, 11, 6, 0]

ls = [744125, 935, 407, 454, 430, 90, 144, 6710213, 889, 810, 2579358]
parts_sums(ls) -> [10037855, 9293730, 9292795, 9292388, 9291934, 9291504, 9291414, 9291270, 2581057, 2580168, 2579358, 0]
